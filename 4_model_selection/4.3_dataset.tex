\subsection{Dataset Size}

In general more data is always better. A limited dataset might not be representative of the underlying distribution. 

Usually $y$ is noisy: $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ in that case a small number of samples and a complex model will overfit the sample noise.

In the noiseless case $n \rightarrow \infty \Rightarrow L_{train}(f(x)) \rightarrow 0$

For $n < d $ GD finds the solution that minimizes $||\omega||_2$
