\subsection{Closed Solution}

If $X^TX $ is invertible $ (X^TX\text{ has full rank} \Leftrightarrow rank(X) = min(d,n)) \Rightarrow$ closed solution: $\omega = \boldsymbol{(X^TX)^{-1}X^TY}$

$\nabla L$ is $\mathbb{O}(nd)$, closed solution is $\mathbb{O}(nd^2)$.

Can't apply closed solution for linearly dependent features.

\textbf{Note:} the closed solution can also be seen as finding the geom. proj. of y onto the hyperplane span(X). $(\boldsymbol{y - X\hat{\omega}})^TX\omega = 0$
