\subsection{Autoencoders}

Aim at NN Identity encoding - decoding and then throw away the decoder.

Problem: Encoded features are not necessarily the best for ML task at hand. Features in latent space can take random form $\rightarrow$ bad for generation.

\textbf{Variational Auto Encoders:} AE with probabilistic latent space. E.g. yield parameters of distribution after encoding and sample from it for decoder. (also multiple latent reps. possible (HVAE))
